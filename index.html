In particular, we have entered a paradigm of network with multiple distinct types of participants representing the supply and demand of a specific commodity or service.</p> <p>This tutorial aims to impart a deep understanding of decision intelligence in two-sided marketplaces, with a particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making for long-term optimization. Attendees will explore the design and management of such marketplaces, with case studies in ridesharing, and learn to tackle their unique challenges. They will gain practical skills in supply-demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, online matching, growth strategies and A/B testing, applicable to real-world situations. By the end of the tutorial, they should be proficient in applying these techniques and evaluating these systems, a valuable asset for AAAI community members interested in marketplace dynamics and decision intelligence.</p> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <p><a href="assets/pdf/Tutorial.pdf">ðŸ“„ Click here to view the lecture slides! ðŸŽ‰</a></p> <p>ðŸ“¢ The recordings will be available soon! ðŸŽ¥ Stay tuned!</p> <h2 id="tutorial-organizers">Tutorial Organizers</h2> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="100" class="wp-image-91149" src="https://aaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TonyQin_profile_pic.jpeg" alt="Zhiwei (Tony) Qin" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 10px;"> <p> <strong>Zhiwei (Tony) Qin</strong> is Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Eva AI (<a href="http://foreva.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foreva.ai</a>).

He works at the interface of RL and statistics, with applications to ride-sharing and healthcare. His work brings to light the relevance and significance of statistical learning in RL, and demonstrates the usefulness of RL as a framework for policy evaluation and A/B testing in two-sided marketplaces. Chengchun has published approximately 70 papers, with half of them accepted in prestigious statistical journals (JRSSB, JASA, AoS) and top machine learning venues (NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, JMLR). His outstanding contributions have been recognized with esteemed awards such as the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Tweedie Award, the Royal Statistical Society Research Prize and ICSA Outstanding Young Research Award. He is serving as the associate editors of JRSSB, JASA and Journal of Nonparametric Statistics. He also serves as a reviewer for a range of machine learning conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, and KDD. </p> </div> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="97" class="wp-image-91151" src="https://aaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/zhu-hongtu-2023-002.jpg" alt="Hongtu Zhu" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 100px; border-radius: 10px;"> <p> <strong>Hongtu Zhu</strong> is a tenured professor of biostatistics, statistics, computer science, and genetics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
