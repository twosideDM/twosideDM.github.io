Two-sided marketplaces have emerged as viable business models in many real-world applications, such as ridesharing, retail, vacation rental, and food delivery. In particular, we have entered a paradigm of network with multiple distinct types of participants representing the supply and demand of a specific commodity or service.

This tutorial aims to impart a deep understanding of decision intelligence in two-sided marketplaces, with a particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making for long-term optimization. Attendees will explore the design and management of such marketplaces, with case studies in ridesharing, and learn to tackle their unique challenges. They will gain practical skills in supply-demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, online matching, growth strategies and A/B testing, applicable to real-world situations. By the end of the tutorial, they should be proficient in applying these techniques and evaluating these systems, a valuable asset for AAAI community members interested in marketplace dynamics and decision intelligence.

    <strong>Zhiwei (Tony) Qin</strong> is Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Eva AI 
    (<a href="http://foreva.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foreva.ai</a>). 
    Previously, he was Principal Scientist at Lyft Rideshare Labs and Director of the Decision Intelligence 
    group at DiDi AI Labs, spearheading the development of reinforcement learning (RL) for rideshare 
    marketplace optimization. Tony received his Ph.D. in Operations Research from Columbia University.

    He is Associate Editor of the ACM Journal on Autonomous Transportation Systems. He has served as
    Area Chair/Senior PC of KDD, AAAI, and ECML-PKDD, and a referee of top journals.&nbsp;
    He is an INFORMS Senior Member, a Franz Edelman Award Finalist and Laureate in 2023, and received the
    INFORMS Daniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice in 2019.

    He is the lead author of the book`<em>`Reinforcement Learning in the Ridesharing Marketplace `</em>`
    published by Springer.

<p>
    <strong>Chengchun Shi</strong> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at LSE. He works at the interface of RL and statistics, with applications 
    to ride-sharing and healthcare. His work brings to light the relevance and significance of statistical learning in RL, and demonstrates the usefulness of RL as a 
    framework for policy evaluation and A/B testing in two-sided marketplaces. Chengchun has published approximately 70 papers, with half of them accepted in 
    prestigious statistical journals (JRSSB, JASA, AoS) and top machine learning venues (NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, JMLR). His outstanding contributions have been 
    recognized with esteemed awards such as the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Tweedie Award, the Royal Statistical Society Research Prize and ICSA Outstanding 
    Young Research Award. He is serving as the associate editors of JRSSB, JASA and Journal of Nonparametric Statistics. He also serves as a reviewer for a range of 
    machine learning conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, and KDD.
